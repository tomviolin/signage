 093\n\n\n\nThanks\, Mal.  I understand if it won’t work out\; Saturdays 
 are odd days.  There would be 5-10 people—the instructor and a handful o
 f student teachers.  We wouldn’t be sure until placements for Spring stu
 dent teaching are made.  But it’s a small program\, so no more than 10.\

  you out!  Unfortunately since we've had some budget cuts\, we don't have 
 a security officer in the building on the weekends\, so I would need appro
 val from the Dean and our Assistant Dean of Facilities before I can confir
 m (we can no longer unlock the doors on the weekend).  Do you know how man
 y people it will be?  I'll try to talk them into allowing access with ePan
 ther ID cards again\, that seemed to work this past semester\; I just want
  to be upfront with you in case they say no.  The Provost is here now\, so
  I might be able to give you an update for a couple days.  I'll keep you u
 pdated and do my best.\n\n\n\nMal\n\n  _____\n\nFrom: Kerry A Korinek\nSen

 writing days.  Would it be possible for us to once again use 3093 (or anot
 her small room)?  The dates are Saturdays\, 8:30-3:30\, on 2/25\, 3/11\, a
