SUMMARY:Seminar with Eric Anderson\, NOAA
DESCRIPTION:Ice Forecasting and Turbulent Heat Flux Simulation in the Next-Generation Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS) \nThe next-generation GLOFS models include a suite of improvements to hydrodynamic prediction in the Great Lakes including finer coastal resolution\, calibration of turbulent heat fluxes\, and ice formation. The goal of these improvements is to move away from a siloed approach to geophysical science and toward an integrated approach for total water prediction. I will introduce the latest updates to GLOFS and present recent work on ice forecasting\, comparison of model fluxes to over-lake measurements\, and connections to public safety. \n\nDr. Eric Anderson is a physical oceanographer with the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor\, MI. He received his Ph.D. in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering from Case Western Reserve University\, and began his research on the Great Lakes while working at the University of Michigan as a Research Scientist before taking his current position at NOAA. His research focuses on the hydrodynamics of the lakes and connecting channels\, including development of Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS)\, which provides nowcast and forecast conditions of currents\, water temperature\, water level fluctuations\, and ice. This work also drives investigations of contaminant transport (e.g. oil spill movement) such as in the Straits of Mackinac\, harmful algal blooms extent and intensity\, and hypoxia in Lake Erie.\n
